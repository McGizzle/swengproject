The inventory tracking app is required perform the following functions:

1) Add projects. Each project has a name, individuals attached to it, and an end-date.

2) Add individuals. Each individual has a name. An individual may be attached to none, one

or many projects.

3) Attach individuals to projects.

4) Scan and identify a barcode identifying an object.

5) Assign object to either an individual or a project

     ? If assigned to a project, then a person from that project must be made

       responsible for the project.

6) Generate a list of objects that must be re-claimed, as of a user-specified date.

7) Generate a list of objects, attached to an individual or a project, as of a user-specified

   date.

8) Scan a barcode of an object already existing in the system, and identify the individual or

project it is assigned to. If assigned to a project, identify the individual on the project who

is responsible for the object.

9) Mark an object as 'Damaged'. When an object is marked as 'damaged', it does not need to be reclaimed anymore. This means that it will
   also not show up in any re-claim list that is generated. However, it will still show as being assigned to an individual or a project,
   as the case may be, with an additional UI indication that it has been damaged. The UI indication is up to the team (text/image/any other mechanism)

10) Generate a list of 'damaged' objects, as of a user-specified date.
